# Data Cleaning & Visualization

## Overview
This project demonstrates skills in **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** using Python and Pandas.  
The dataset initially contained missing values and duplicates, and it has been cleaned for analysis.  

Visualizations include:  
- **Line chart** – showing Height vs Weight trends  
- **Bar chart** – showing average Weight per Height range  
- **Pie chart** – showing distribution of Height bins  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Files in this Repository
- `Project1.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with all code and charts  
- `cleaned_hw_200_metric.csv` → Cleaned dataset  
- `line_chart.png` → Line chart visualization  
- `bar_chart.png` → Bar chart visualization  
- `pie_chart.png` → Pie chart visualization  
- `README.md` → This project description  

## Usage
1. Open `Project1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all cells to reproduce the charts and the cleaned dataset.  

## Outcome
- Cleaned dataset ready for analysis or reporting  
- Professional visualizations suitable for presentation or client work  
- Demonstrates practical **data analysis and visualization skills**
